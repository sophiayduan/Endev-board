# Endev

Its a system that monitors my printer using electronic and mechanical components.

Features:

* Form factor: fits inside the spool holder bracket
* Mounting: Magnets that align with the spool holder bracket
* Peripherals: Accelerometer (to detect intense vibration), Temp/humidity sensor (self explanatory), ESP-12F (for sending notifications over wifi), Configuration switches, status LED
* Filament movement detection: Checks if the filament is moving or not (e.g. filament runout, jam)
* LED strip attachment: so I can illuminate my printer 

I built it as my printer is not known for its reliability, so by tracking common points of failure, I can hopefully stop the print without needing to check on my printer every few minutes.
 

## PCB

It's not the best but hopefully it works


## CAD

Note: 
- The bearing in the cad is not the one i'll be using (I'll be using a u-groove one)
- The renders aren't great but i'll improve them soon
  
3d printing step files and additional pictures are in the cad folder
