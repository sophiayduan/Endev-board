# Endev-board
Dev board tracking 3D printer conditions for my Ender 3
I made this since my printer is pretty unreliable and I find myself checking on it every few minutes, i'd like to be able to trust that it is printing without needing to check anything.


Features:
- Battery powered
- Sensors: Accelerometer, Temp and Humidity,
- Leds to illuminate the printer

If an error is detected, it will send a notification to my phone, so I know to go check on my printer. 


My project is based off of @[karmanyaahm](https://github.com/karmanyaahm)'s amazing [jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sparkletilt-pcb/part-1)
It taught me loads about the basics of working with MCU's.
