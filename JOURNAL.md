**Running hour total: 16.5h**

# June 27th: Planning + basic schematic

**Total time spent: ~0.5h**

Followed this [hackclub jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sparkletilt-pcb/part-1) tutorial to begin my dev board

Planned out possible features:
- Volume detection
- Filament extrusion dectection
- Accelerometer for vibrations
- Temperature and humidity sensor
- Wi-Fi remote monitoring 
- I/O pins for testing
- Removable magnets to mount it
- LiPo powered

# June 28th: Finishing the schematic
**Total time spent: 9h**

I continued the tutorial and then added additional periferals and features that are specific to monitoring my printer.
Here is the temporary schematic: The pictures are of features I personally added or modified

Lots of time was spent today learning different concepts. I think this is my v1 schematic finished, I just need to make sure everything will work, then i'll start searching for more footprints...

# June 29th: Beginning the PCB
**Total time spent: 5.5h**

I slightly modified my design, having the LEDs be a separate pcb for my bar light that can be connected to the main pcb, and chose to switch to the SK6812 for a greater brightness. 

Most of today was spent chosing parts, learning how to add custom symbols/footprints/3d models, PCB editor features (alignment was a game changer) and fixing my schematic from feedback I received.

I only managed to begin the layout of the led strip:

# June 29th: The LED strip
**Total time spent: 1.5h**

Somewhat finished the LED strip pcb and that case. 
I plan on pausing the print midway through, inserting the neodymium magnets then resuming, since they are really brittle I don't want to damage them.
