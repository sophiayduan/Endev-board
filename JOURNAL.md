# June 27th: Planning + basic schematic

**Total time spent: ~0.5h**

Followed this [hackclub jam](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sparkletilt-pcb/part-1) tutorial to begin my dev board

Planned out possible features:
- Volume detection
- Filament extrusion dectection
- Accelerometer for vibrations
- Temperature and humidity sensor
- Wi-Fi remote monitoring 
- I/O pins for testing
- Removable magnets to mount it
- LiPo powered

# June 28th: Finishing the PCB
**Total time spent: 9h**

I continued the tutorial and then added additional periferals and features that are specific to monitoring my printer.
Here is the temporary schematic: The pictures are of features I personally added or modified

Lots of time was spent today learning different concepts. I think this is my schematic finished, I just need to make sure everything will work, then i'll start searching for more footprints...
